#### **🎯 Optimization Features:**
```python
class PerformanceOptimizer:
    - Animation disabling during collection
    - Reduced update frequency
    - Memory usage optimization
    - CPU load balancing
```

### **5. Automatic Duplicate Cleanup Integration**

#### **🧹 Post-Collection Cleanup:**
- **Automatic Execution**: Runs after each collection
- **Zero User Intervention**: Completely automatic
- **Performance Optimized**: Fast cleanup operations
- **Database Safety**: Transaction-safe operations
